# nf-core/funcscan: Output

## Introduction

The output of nf-core/funcscan provides the output directories from each tool applied, as well as a summary of tool outputs for each of the functional groups: antibiotic resistance genes ([DeepARG](https://bitbucket.org/gusphdproj/deeparg-ss/src/master/), [fargene](https://github.com/fannyhb/fargene), [RGI](https://card.mcmaster.ca/analyze/rgi)), antimicrobial peptides ([macrel](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/macrel), [hmmsearch](http://hmmer.org)), biosynthetic gene clusters ([antiSMASH](https://docs.antismash.secondarymetabolites.org)) and functional annotation ([prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka)).

Furtermore, summary statistics of the whole run is presented in a [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) report.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory (specified by the `--outdir` flag) after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to this top-level output directory. The default directory sturcture of nf-core/funcscan is:

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.
